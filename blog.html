However, it’s probably safe to say that most of us have spoken with a chatbot agent or voice user interface having experienced none of these things. For an agent that’s meant to be exploratory and conversational, if it doesn’t sound human, then it’s just not\u0026#8230;fun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo when our partner the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fieldmuseum.org/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eField Museum\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e in Chicago approached us to help build a chat personality for their newest—and biggest—dinosaur addition, Máximo the Titanosaur, we saw an opportunity to create a remarkable conversational experience.

I worked directly with the museum mapping conversation logic, testing and translating user needs into chatbot intents, setting up the chatbot management system, and creating the chat interfaces that Máximo uses to converse with users.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHere are some of the most impactful things I learned bringing Máximo back to life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eFraming the conversation reduces user frustration\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAt their core, chatbot conversations can be relatively simple: they consist of a user query, otherwise known as a “training phrase,” which triggers an “intent” response from the chatbot agent. You can think of intents as the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003ethings your chatbot can do\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e, or similarly, the questions it can answer. An in-depth look at how to identify, test, and prioritize your bot’s intents based on user needs is outside the scope of this article; however, educating users on what they should expect of a bot \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003eabsolutely is\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThe goal for all chatbot conversations is to maximize the rate at which the bot correctly detects a user\u0026#8217;s intent. For conversational bots, there’s no specific purchase path to help guide the conversation like there would be for a transactional bot. As a result, conversational chatbot experiences end up becoming a subtle balance of leading users through a maze of desired intents without making it seem like you’re dictating the conversation. It’s important to make sure your bot serves those intents by \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003eexposing what it can do up front\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e. It’s also important to ensure that it’s appropriately listening for the ways that users make those intents known.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_4936\" style=\"width: 249px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-4936 size-medium\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eIn this earlier iteration, Máximo’s framing is unclear. As a user, I’m not sure what Máximo knows about from his welcome greeting alone. Giving the user the bounds of what your agent knows about sets the tone for the entire conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eIn initial user testing, we found that we didn’t frame Máximo’s conversational abilities quite well enough. As a result, we got a lot of left-field questions that resulted in unmatched, or “fallback” responses.
