<h4>A Dinosaur Chatbot for the Field Museum</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><b>conversational chatbot experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> should be many things: delightful, roundabout, surprising, and organic. However, it’s probably safe to say that most of us have spoken with a chatbot agent or voice user interface having experienced none of these things. For an agent that’s meant to be exploratory and conversational, if it doesn’t sound human, then it’s just not&#8230;fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So when our partner the </span><a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Field Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Chicago approached us to help build a chat personality for their newest—and biggest—dinosaur addition, Máximo the Titanosaur, we saw an opportunity to create a remarkable conversational experience. With partner </span><a href="https://leoburnett.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Leo Burnett’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> visual and messaging support, the Field Museum did an amazing job creating a truly lovable character for Máximo; his voice truly evolved through the Field’s social media work (congrats on that </span><a href="https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2019/social/general-social/education-discovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Webby award, Field Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">!). I worked directly with the museum mapping conversation logic, testing and translating user needs into chatbot intents, setting up the chatbot management system, and creating the chat interfaces that Máximo uses to converse with users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are some of the most impactful things I learned bringing Máximo back to life.</span></p>
<h4>Framing the conversation reduces user frustration</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At their core, chatbot conversations can be relatively simple: they consist of a user query, otherwise known as a “training phrase,” which triggers an “intent” response from the chatbot agent. You can think of intents as the </span><b>things your chatbot can do</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, or similarly, the questions it can answer. An in-depth look at how to identify, test, and prioritize your bot’s intents based on user needs is outside the scope of this article; however, educating users on what they should expect of a bot </span><b>absolutely is</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The goal for all chatbot conversations is to maximize the rate at which the bot correctly detects a user&#8217;s intent. For conversational bots, there’s no specific purchase path to help guide the conversation like there would be for a transactional bot. As a result, conversational chatbot experiences end up becoming a subtle balance of leading users through a maze of desired intents without making it seem like you’re dictating the conversation. It’s important to make sure your bot serves those intents by </span><b>exposing what it can do up front</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s also important to ensure that it’s appropriately listening for the ways that users make those intents known.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_4936" style="width: 249px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-4936 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-1.png" alt="" width="239" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In this earlier iteration, Máximo’s framing is unclear. As a user, I’m not sure what Máximo knows about from his welcome greeting alone. Giving the user the bounds of what your agent knows about sets the tone for the entire conversation.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In initial user testing, we found that we didn’t frame Máximo’s conversational abilities quite well enough. As a result, we got a lot of left-field questions that resulted in unmatched, or “fallback” responses. Once we framed the conversation with what Máximo could and couldn’t do, we got </span><b>user queries that were much more aligned</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> with what we wanted them to ask.</span></p>
<h4><b>Grammatical listeners lead to organic conversation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted Máximo to be able to handle as much spontaneous human conversation as possible. Sure, he needed to be able to handle their Cretaceous knowledge areas with the wizened knowledge of a 101-million-year-old titanosaur, but I wanted to make conversing with this gentle giant as delightful and organic as possible, even when dealing with things they didn’t know much about. This included situations like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ambiguous pronouns in follow-up responses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Organic user reactions to Máximo responses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The range of random requests and assertions that users might make to a dinosaur</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you might imagine, this quickly became difficult to manage. I discovered early on that I could </span><b>only go so far with framing</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Random user queries were still there: delightful, frustrating, and impossible to keep up with. In the beginning, I directed that randomness to fallback answers when the natural language processing (NLP) engine did not. With every user testing session, however, I grew more and more frustrated that Máximo could only respond with a variant of the same fallback response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After initial user testing, I hypothesized that the key to managing this randomness was to </span><b>create grammatical listeners</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Using </span><a href="https://dialogflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">DialogFlow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as our bot management system, I designed these to pick up the “gray area” of clauses that were a) common patterns of conversation in English and b) some of the most frequently used sentence constructions found in our user testing sessions. Here are just a few examples:</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why” clauses</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The “why” clause is designed to detect queries like: “Why is the sky blue?” or “Why do you think SUE likes Jeff Goldblum so much?” It’s not intended to detect a phrase like “Why are you so big?” since we have a specific response for that.</span></li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_4937" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-4937 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-2.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Máximo’s personality helps him deflect a “why” clause question with ease. He really, really, really likes eating ferns. I would definitely ask him about it sometime.</p></div>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think” clauses</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The “I think” clause is designed to detect a variety of user opinions, such as, “I think that is a stupid idea,” or “I think the non-canon Old Republic content in the Star Wars Expanded Universe is superior to anything post episode VI,” but not “I think you are an awesome friend,” since we also have a specific intent for that.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surprise-related” clauses</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">For these, I used NLP powered sentiment analysis to group like phrases of positive user emotion. I then provided on-brand responses to users expressing surprise to Máximo’s earlier statements.</span></li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_4938" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-4938 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-3.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The user phrase “oh wow” helps to trigger Máximo’s “surprise” intent.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power of the listeners </span><b>allows for precise responses while being delightfully flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. If a more specific instance of this clause exists, it should match that intent. But if it doesn’t, it gets swept up by the listener.</span></p>
<h4>Linguistic ambiguity creates conversational forgiveness</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as keywords power specific ad groups in a sound SEM strategy, agent responses should be as comprehensive as the phrases that power them. Not only should your agent provide entertaining responses to a few niche phrases, but they should also be equally as entertaining when responding to a grab bag of user queries with an </span><b>on-brand, ambiguous response</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, it’s not realistic to expect Máximo to have a response to every single Chicago attraction that he might enjoy. Admitting that Máximo hasn’t had a chance to try everything Chicago has to offer isn’t a cop out &#8211; it’s the truth! (Also, he is certainly far too large to fit in most of the doors.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, you can </span><b>use your bot’s character to respond as they would</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> while </span><b>not expecting them to be more perfect than a human</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Do YOU know everything people ask of you? Have grace with your agents, and allow them the ambiguity in responses to do so. User testing revealed that users generally didn’t abandon conversations when Máximo was ambiguous with them; in fact, a clever, ambiguous response usually prolonged the length of the conversation.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_4939" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4939" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-4.png" alt="" width="300" height="141" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It’s okay for your agent to admit defeat! If users still see something of their own question in the agent’s response, they’ll see it less as a failure and more as an aspect of the agent’s personality.</p></div>
<h4><b>“Mistakes are design opportunities”</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My high school art teacher framed this quote on the wall. I probably think about it at least 3-4 times every day. Your bot will use your fallback response even more frequently. There is no avoiding this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take heart, though. An </span><b>unmatched intent is an opportunity</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> for you based on how you word your agent’s fallback responses. These are arguably some of your most powerful responses, so it is important to consider the following when crafting them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Avoid making them dead ends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ensure you have many varieties</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Use them to pivot users into new threads of conversation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Avoid seeing fallbacks as failures</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and leverage them as opportunities to keep users engaged.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_4940" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-4940 size-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-5.png" alt="" width="266" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Máximo doesn’t have a follow-up for this query, but mentioning a fun fact about when Stegosaurus and T. rex lived keeps this conversation from going extinct.</p></div>
<h4><b>You can learn a lot by reading, but you learn the most from users</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of the above insights would have been possible without </span><b>frequent user testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Whether testing was conducted in-person at the museum, remotely, or in-office, the sessions included diverse audiences that helped us assess the content of user responses and the usability of the web and SMS chatbot interfaces. Without the testing we conducted, we would not have anticipated the huge effect that proper framing would have on conversation. Similarly, I would not have anticipated the need for grammatical listeners without studying the patterns from these user conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether you’re designing a conversational agent, a checkout flow, or a landing page for a new product launch, </span><b>you can’t expect to know your users without listening to them</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Test your agent thoroughly up front so that it can be the best conversational experience for your users, and the best user sentiment gathering tool for you. If your chatbot can listen to your users better than you can, it won’t just talk with them, it’ll connect in a way that will delight them and provide you with priceless insight.</span></p>

However, it’s probably safe to say that most of us have spoken with a chatbot agent or voice user interface having experienced none of these things. For an agent that’s meant to be exploratory and conversational, if it doesn’t sound human, then it’s just not\u0026#8230;fun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eSo when our partner the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fieldmuseum.org/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eField Museum\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e in Chicago approached us to help build a chat personality for their newest—and biggest—dinosaur addition, Máximo the Titanosaur, we saw an opportunity to create a remarkable conversational experience.

I worked directly with the museum mapping conversation logic, testing and translating user needs into chatbot intents, setting up the chatbot management system, and creating the chat interfaces that Máximo uses to converse with users.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eHere are some of the most impactful things I learned bringing Máximo back to life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eFraming the conversation reduces user frustration\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAt their core, chatbot conversations can be relatively simple: they consist of a user query, otherwise known as a “training phrase,” which triggers an “intent” response from the chatbot agent. You can think of intents as the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003ethings your chatbot can do\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e, or similarly, the questions it can answer. An in-depth look at how to identify, test, and prioritize your bot’s intents based on user needs is outside the scope of this article; however, educating users on what they should expect of a bot \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003eabsolutely is\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThe goal for all chatbot conversations is to maximize the rate at which the bot correctly detects a user\u0026#8217;s intent. For conversational bots, there’s no specific purchase path to help guide the conversation like there would be for a transactional bot. As a result, conversational chatbot experiences end up becoming a subtle balance of leading users through a maze of desired intents without making it seem like you’re dictating the conversation. It’s important to make sure your bot serves those intents by \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003eexposing what it can do up front\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e. It’s also important to ensure that it’s appropriately listening for the ways that users make those intents known.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_4936\" style=\"width: 249px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-4936 size-medium\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.prpl.rs/images/blog/maximo-image-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eIn this earlier iteration, Máximo’s framing is unclear. As a user, I’m not sure what Máximo knows about from his welcome greeting alone. Giving the user the bounds of what your agent knows about sets the tone for the entire conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eIn initial user testing, we found that we didn’t frame Máximo’s conversational abilities quite well enough. As a result, we got a lot of left-field questions that resulted in unmatched, or “fallback” responses. Once we framed the conversation with what Máximo could and couldn’t do, we got \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003euser queries that were much more aligned\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e with what we wanted them to ask.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cb\u003eGrammatical listeners lead to organic conversation\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eI wanted Máximo to be able to handle as much spontaneous human conversation as possible. Sure, he needed to be able to handle their Cretaceous knowledge areas with the wizened knowledge of a 101-million-year-old titanosaur, but I wanted to make conversing with this gentle giant as delightful and organic as possible, even when dealing with things they didn’t know much about. This included situations like:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAmbiguous pronouns in follow-up responses\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eOrganic user reactions to Máximo responses\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eThe range of random requests and assertions that users might make to a dinosaur\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAs you might imagine, this quickly became difficult to manage. I discovered early on that I could \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003eonly go so far with framing\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e. Random user queries were still there: delightful, frustrating, and impossible to keep up with. In the beginning, I directed that randomness to fallback answers when the natural language processing (NLP) engine did not. With every user testing session, however, I grew more and more frustrated that Máximo could only respond with a variant of the same fallback response.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003eAfter initial user testing, I hypothesized that the key to managing this randomness was to \u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003ecreate grammatical listeners\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"\u003e.
